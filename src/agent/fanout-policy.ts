/**
 * Sub-agent fan-out policy for autonomous tasks.
 *
 * Why: even with a small tool surface, a single agent context can fill
 * within a few turns when tool responses are large (Outlook list dumps,
 * web search results, file reads, multi-prospect research). The SDK's
 * autocompact then has nothing to compact and aborts with
 * `rapid_refill_breaker`. The fix matching how Claude Code is designed:
 * spawn sub-agents that each handle a slice of work in their own
 * isolated context and return only a compact summary back to the parent.
 *
 * The Agent tool already exists in the SDK. The problem is timing —
 * agents tend to discover the need for fan-out only after thrashing.
 * This module front-loads the directive: scan the task description for
 * signals that fan-out will be needed, and inject a strong, explicit
 * mandate at the top of the prompt.
 *
 * Two outputs:
 *  - buildAlwaysOnParallelizationHint()
 *      Short reminder injected into every autonomous prompt. Cheap.
 *  - buildFanoutDirective(detectFanoutSignals(text).signals)
 *      Stronger, explicit fan-out contract. Only injected when signals
 *      indicate the task is genuinely multi-item or broad-scope.

// decomposes into parallel Haiku/Sonnet sub-agents, each in its own
// context. The user's main agent never sees the big tool responses
// — it never gets a chance to thrash.

// Conservative gate: false positives waste a planner LLM call (~$0.05)

// path runs, which is the status quo. So we tune for false positives.
